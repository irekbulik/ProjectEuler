# euler

It is high time to start collecting Project Euler solutions. 

* I will not redo all pre-github problems.

* Some solutions may still be bruteforced. Timings are reported.  

* Algorithms are either obvious or are documented in the code. 

* clearly J solutions are quite lame but I learn as I go
