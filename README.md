 ##Disclaimer:
**I feel uneasy keeping this repository pubic. Please do not use it to find the answers without solving the problems first!**

**Notes to self**

* I did not save solutions to problems I solved long time ago. I do not feel like redoing them.

* Some solutions may still be bruteforced. Timings are then reported.  

* Algorithms are either obvious or are documented in the code. 

* clearly J solutions are quite lame compared to the masters on the forum, but they are getting better 

* well, 473 is quite cool and it does seem I guessed the answer.. and used int\*16
  (I don't want to look at forum before I solve it well)
