**Disclaimer:** 
**I feel uneasy keeping this repository pubic. Please do not use to find the answers without solving the problems first!**

It is high time to start collecting Project Euler solutions. 

* I will not redo all pre-github problems.

* Some solutions may still be bruteforced. Timings are reported.  

* Algorithms are either obvious or are documented in the code. 

* clearly J solutions are quite lame but I learn as I go 

* well, 473 is quite cool and it does seem I guessed the answer.. and used integer*16
  (I don't want to look at forum before I solve it well)
