Well, here I was too smart and looked for y that is both sum and difference of squares.
Then I looked up the values that form them and creates x,z. Then i checked if  their sum and difference is square.
The problem is that my binary search failed for some cutoff, due to nonuniqness. Did not like the problem, won't work on it more.
